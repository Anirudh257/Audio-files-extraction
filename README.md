# Audio-files-extraction

This is a project on **Audio Classification using Deep Learning**. I am using the Google-audioset dataset for this project and Tensorflow and Keras on Jupyter Notebook. 

Initially, I solved a simple problem of classifying **Clapping** from non-clapping human examples. I used a single-label dataset for this classification and the results of the various classifications can be found in the file uploaded on this repository.

Then, I moved on to solve the classification problem on multi-label datasets using multi-label classification algorithms like **label powerset**,**binary relevance**,and **Classifier chain methods**. 

Further progress in the project will be updated soon!!!
